The formula feels nice when you first apply it (slippery Vaseline consistency but smoother in formula) but it doesn’t hang around long and has never lasted through the night with me. I really wanted to like this because it has a huge influencer and TikTok following but it is overhyped and overpriced for a Vaseline-like mask in my opinion. I tried the original mask and the light berry scent reminds me of bubblegum-scented numbing oral gel, which isn’t pleasant. As well as being pricey, Laneige is not cruelty-free. I think Bite Beauty’s agave mask or Tatcha’s Lip Mask are better, luxury lip masks if you do not want to use Vaseline and I find that both are in a similar price point but have been more moisturizing and cruelty free.",Overhyped and Overpriced,light,hazel,combination,blonde,P420652,Lip Sleeping Mask Intense Hydration with Vitamin C,LANEIGE,24.0

First things first, I would not consider this an overnight lip mask as it only lasts about an hour/hour and a half (that’s even pushing it) after application. My routine with this is usually to apply it right before I head to bed. I’ll usually browse through my phone/read a book for an hour or so before I actually sleep.

Furthermore, I have not noticed a change in the moisture/hydration of my lips in the mornings after applying this the nights before. At times, I even find that my lips are drier after I use this product. The only components that I enjoy about this product is that it comes with a good amount and the peppermint scent is very refreshing. I find that this lip sleeping mask is only really benefiting me when I want to lather something on my lips to make it slippery and smooth for an hour (like lip balms that don’t have other uses but to make your lips feel smooth in that moment).I would not recommend this product and I will not be repurchasing it.",Not what is says it is,,brown,dry,black,P420652,Lip Sleeping Mask Intense Hydration with Vitamin C,LANEIGE,24.0

Just wanted to show you guys the color and compare it to the Gingersnap one which was discontinued and which I’m still hoping they will bring back... So, the texture and feel on the lips are the same as all the other Laneige lip masks.  It feels smooth, not grainy at all, kind of like a thick gel but without being sticky or leaving any kind of residue on the lips as it fades.  Those are the positive attributes of this one BUT, sadly, as with the previous limited edition of the Cherry one, I’m disappointed with the scent.  It does smell vaguely of pumpkin spice but in a plasticky, fake kind of way and without any kind of sweetness added to it.  After a couple of minutes on the lips the smell dissipates completely and the slight aftertaste you are left with is reminiscent of vaseline in some way, very artificial...Compared to my beloved Gingersnap (on the left in the included picture), it doesn’t add even the slightest bit of tint to your lips and, of course, doesn’t smell nearly as good.  So, if you are looking to replace your Gingersnap mask (like me) this won’t do it but overall, it’s a good product and does the job it’s intended for.  Moisturizing, doesn’t interfere with other products you plan to apply afterward (when used during the day) and is definitely suitable for this time of the year (I’m writing this in September).  So, if you are just looking for something to “refresh“ your Laneige arsenal, this would be a good addition to it but don’t expect a sweet, gourmand pumpkin spice smell and/or taste.",Good but not a very natural flavour...,light,green,combination,blonde,P420652,Lip Sleeping Mask Intense Hydration with Vitamin C,LANEIGE,24.0

I was anticipating this to smell super sweet (almost like a mango hi-chew candy) because the other ones I own have that artificial kick to them. However, this smells more like an actual mango fruit... sweet with a hint of sour. If you’re sensitive to fragrance but want to try a Laneige lip mask out, Mango would honestly be perfect because it doesn’t pack as much of a punch as Sweet Candy or Gummy Bear, for example, but it still smells good. I took off 1 star because I personally would prefer if this had more of a sweet Mango candy scent but I have no regrets about the purchase and will definitely enjoy using it during the summer.",Great summer scent!,lightMedium,brown,combination,black,P420652,Lip Sleeping Mask Intense Hydration with Vitamin C,LANEIGE,24.0
